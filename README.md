List of reinforcement learning projects I am doing to educate myself about the topic. It also includes the project Udacity's deep reinforcement learning course. There is also an emphasize on clean code, write as much tests as possible, reproducibility and ease of use. Here is the list of projects so far:

- [DQN](p1_Navigation/readme_project.md) (Also implements Double-DQN and Dueling Network)
- [REINFORCE](reinforce/README.md)
